I would suggest you use the first paragraph as an introduction, and the second paragraph as a body. I would also suggest using a more formal tone. The tone should be professional, but not too formal. For example, if you were writing a letter to a doctor, you would probably use more formal language than you would if you were writing a letter to a friend. You would want to use more formal language in the second paragraph because you are trying to provide information to the reader, not to be funny.
